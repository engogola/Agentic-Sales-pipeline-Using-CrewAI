# Agentic-Sales-pipeline-Using-CrewAI
In this repo  inspired by Crew AI  found Jouao Moura taught on deepleraning.ai by Andrew NG.
Agentic pipeline is a workflow that uses Crew ai framework with an LLM(in my case Gemini api key)to tackle complex tasks,the sevaral AI agents each with specific roles and functions working as a team together .
The tasks are iterative and colaboarative in our case on agent seurf the web and obtains infirmation about a potential lead,the other agent scores the lead to idnetify a potential prospect and the other is used to generate emails and send it autonomosly to the lead.


*FLOWS*
The concept of flows inn crew ai define how agents collaborate and communicate to achieve tasks which consists of sequence of tasks and the output of one task can trigger the next.They allow you to create structured and event driven workflows.
